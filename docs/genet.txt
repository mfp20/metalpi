controlling genet activity LED's


genet tx cheap, irq/cpu wise
genet rx is expensive

when iperf is bound to core0 (same as irq), and doing gigabit rx, there is nearly 1 genet A irq for every packet received, 89k irq/sec, irq B is nearly idle, 938 Mbits/sec
if iperf is bound to core1, genet A drops to 68k/sec, and B rises to 19.5k/sec, 941 Mbits/sec
