17: boot mode, exact meaning differs between VC4 and VC6

19: signing key
20
21
22
23: signing key backup
24
25
26


28: the 32bit serial# of the chip, as seen in `cat /proc/cpuinfo
  the lower 24 bits of the serial# also become the last 3 bytes of the ethernet mac`
29: negated backup serial#
30: hw revision
31:
32: has a bit to signal mfg test failure?
  start4.elf will run otp_write(28, 4, 4) if program_mfgtest_fail=1 has been set
  i think otp_write() takes a base otp reg, an otp offset (max of 16), and a value, so the above would program OTP32?
33: a US pi400 has a 4 here, it may be "board_rev_ext"
45: burned MPG2 decode key
46: burned WVC1 decode key

64/64, ethernet mac

rpi3 (and maybe older)
  reg17:
    bit 0, brick the pi! (may enable signature checks)
    bit 1, 1==19.2mhz
    bit 2, 0 means validate OTP key checksum in OTP 27?
    bit 3, enable SDIO pullup
    bit 4, NAND/emmc, enables DMA?
    bit 5, NAND/SMI boot
    bit 8, SMI data bus width
      0=8bit
      1=16bit
    bit 9-10, change SMI bus timings, 0->1cycle, 1->2cycles, 2->3cycles, 3->10cycles
      0:
        2 cycle strobe
        1 pace/hold/setup
      1:
        4 strobe
        2 pace/hold/setup
      2:
        6 strobe
        3 pace/hold/setup
      3:
        10 strobe/pace/hold/setup
    bit 11-12, nand related
    bit 14-17 if 0, treat as 0b1011, becomes bits 2:5 of SMI_A/SMI_DA
    bit 18, nand related
    bit 19, enable GPIO bootmode
    bit 20, MPHI related
    bit 21, enable booting from SDHOST card
    bit 22 sets SDHOST bank to boot from, 0==gpio48-53, 1==gpio22-27
    bit 23-24, SDHCI bank, default=22-27, 1=34-39, 2=48-53, non-zero means try SDHCI boot
    bit 25-26, SDHCI-wide bank, same as 23-24, but 1 is in 8bit mode
    bit 27, BSC slave boot on gpio 18/19 ALT3
    bit 28, enable usb device booting
    bit 29, enable usb host booting (mass-storage, ethernet)
    bit 30-31, SPI boot
      0 disable
      1 gpio 7-11 ALT0
      2 gpio 35-39 ALT0
      3 gpio 46-49 ALT2, undocumented mode!!

rpi4:
  reg17:
    bit 1, 0=54mhz crystal, 1=19.2mhz
    bit 2, 0 means validate OTP key checksum in OTP 27?
    bit 4-6, spi boot pins
      0 = none
      1 = gpio 7-11 alt0
      2 = gpio 35-39 alt0
      3 = gpio 40-43 alt4 (pre-burned)
      4 = gpio 46-49 alt2
    bit 7, usb device boot (over usb-c port), only used if eeprom fails checksum
    bit 8-10 thing1
    bit 11-13, emmc pins
      0 = none
      1 = ??? PI400 is here, it likely means the EMMC2 port
      2 = gpio 22-27 alt3
      3 = gpio 34-39 alt3
      4 = gpio48-53 alt3 (wired to sd card slot)
    bit 28-30 thing2

thing1 and thing2 are compared, and control if 66/67 get loaded


rpi4 only?
OTP register 66 defines two pins that can be used to control boot behaviour
[3:06 PM]
the layout is:
  bit 0-5: boot pin 0 (eMMC/flash boot enable when active)
  bit 6: polarity (0: active HIGH, 1: active LOW)
  bit 7: enable
  bit 8-13: boot pin 1 (disable when active onboard devices)
  bit 14: polarity (0: active HIGH, 1: active LOW)
  bit 15: enable
  bit 24-31: flash start address bits 8-23

to disable onboard devices (sdcard, spi), you must set bit 15 (enable that half), configure 14 (the polarity), and put a pin# in 24-31

66:000095d4 an example value
gpio 20 will enable SD booting when low
gpio 21 will enable SPI booting when low
yes, the action when the requested polatrity is met, is backwards


OTP 67
0x80 enable bit
0x40 first level
0x3f bitmask for pin#

the given pin is set to "first level", then 25ms later, the reverse
