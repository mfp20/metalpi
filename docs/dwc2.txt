> Yes, i also assume the PHY is part of the DWC2 IP. Unfortunately we don't have a PHY driver yet, the devicetree fake this via non-op driver. Maybe this is the root cause of this issue. The BCM2835 datasheet provides a register description for MDIO access incl. VBUS interrupt.
> In case you need a datasheet for the DWC2 IP, try to google for Silicon Labs EZR32WG. It seems to use the same core.
