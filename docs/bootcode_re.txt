config forms an array of 32bit ints

uint type (0 signed/1 unsigned/2 string)
char* to name
void* to destination
uint length?
?? 0 if option not set?

FREEZE_VERSION being non-zero, will force ENABLE_SELF_UPDATE=0

if BOOT_ORDER is zero, default to 0xf21

USB_DEV_BOOT_MAX_RETRIES, NET_BOOT_MAX_RETRIES, USB_MSD_BOOT_MAX_RETRIES, SD_BOOT_MAX_RETRIES all behave the same way
when in the relevant mode, it gets copied to a generic max-tries variable

if (USB_DEV_FILE_TIMEOUT < 10000) USB_DEV_FILE_TIMEOUT = 10000;

long  short
0     4         start4.elf not found

2     4         related to bootloader_upgrade
4     4         start4.elf not compatible with board

bootloader_upgrade will default to 1 if unset
bootloader_upgrade is forced 0 if ENABLE_SELF_UPDATE=0



2019-12-03:
has a function to scan the entire SPI and generate an array containing magic/name/start/length
checks .text.bootloader_state
`struct bootloader_state` is 0x164 bytes long

2020-05-15:
has a function to scan the SPI on-demand, searching for a file with a given name
checks .text.bootloader_state
checks .text.firmware_rev
`struct bootloader_state` is 0x1b8 bytes long


.text.bootloader_state
a section in the .elf file, gets populated if it contains BSTA
if (state[0] == 'BSTA') state[1] = 0x40000;
0x40000 is the address of the bootloader state made by start_elf just before entering the elf

upon entry to start.elf:
* 0x20000 has 0x400 bytes of nulls to wipe something
* 0x40000 contains the full `struct bootloader_state`

struct bootloader_state {
  char[4] tag;
  uint32_t size2;
  uint32_t size; // including this header
  char[] payload;
}
known tags:
tag  size2        size
BSTE 0x164/0x1b8  0xc       , no payload
BVER 0x6c         0x6c      , revision, type, date, time, unknown, serial, revision-related
BSTS 0x18         0x18      , unknown payload
BSTN 0xc0/0xc4    0xc0/0xc4 , macend, macstart, mymac, serial_string, tftp_ip, prefix_thing
BSTM 0x14         0x0/0x14  , sometimes the last field
BUSB 0x50         0x0       , sometimes the last field

a size of 0 seems to indicate end of list?



on VC4:
0xc010_0000 (1mb into ram) appears to be the temp buffer the ELF is held at during loading

gpio3 is the wake-on-halt pin by default, pairing up to dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown
gpio1 is wake-on-halt for rpi 1 a rev 0/1


from a vc4 bootcode.bin, try this later
PM_SMPS = 0x5a000001;
A2W_SMPS_LDO1 = 0x5a040000;
A2W_SMPS_LDO0 = 0x5a000000;
*REG32(0x7e102190) |= 0x5a000010;
