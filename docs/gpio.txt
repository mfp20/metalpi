GPFSEL_, gpio function select registers, 6 registers, 32bits wide each, 3 bits per gpio pin, with 2 bits reserved in each register
each register can describe 10 function selects, for a total of 60 function selections

GPSET_, gpio set registers, writing a 0 to a bit has no effect, writing a 1 to a bit sets that gpio as high, but only if the gpio is an output
GPCLR_, gpio clear registers, writing a 1 clears a gpio output

GPPUD, master pull-up/pull-down enable, see further notes
GPPUDCLKn, gpio pullup/down clock enable

to change the pullup config:
* write the desired mode to GPPUD (off=0, down=1, up=2)
* delay for 150 clock cycles
* write a 1 to the bits of GPPUDCLKn that correspond to GPIO pins you want to modify the state of
* delay for another 150 clock cycles
* write a zero to GPPUD
* write 0 to GPPUDCLKn

for the bcm2711/rpi4:
pullup control signal is 2 bits wide (mask of 0x3)
the register offset (which register) is gpio/16
the bit-shift within that register is (gpio % 16) * 2

looks to be AVR style, just a giant block of bits, just like the function select ones
2 bits per pin, off=0, up=1, down=2, 16 pins per 32bit reg, 4 registers in total?


rpi4 SD stuff

> The new SDHCI-compliant EMMC2 interface doesn't appear on the GPIOs - it has dedicated pins
, but to allow booting from SD card without a completely new boot ROM it is possible to map the old ARASAN/EMMC/SDIO interface to those dedicated pins.
This is controlled by bit 1 of 0x7e2000d0 - 0=EMMC2, 1=legacy EMMC.
> No, not yet. The only other relevant bit would be the one that enables the RGMII PHY signals onto GPIOs 46+, but you don't want to change that.

bit 0, emmc muxing
bit 1, rgmii muxing

to use RGMII, configure:
0x7e2000d0 |= 1; // mux the high-speed signals onto 46-57
GPIO28-29, ALT5 (RGMII_MDIO and RGMII_MDC)
GPIO28    pull-down
GPIO29    pull-up
GPIO46-57 pull-up

> By default GPIOs 0-8 pull up, whilst 9-27 pull down. No, those defaults can't be changed.
