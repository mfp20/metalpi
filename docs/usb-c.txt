both CC pins on a usb-c port should have matching resistors
Rp pullup for a "downstream" port
Rd pulldown for an "upstream" port
Ra pulldown for e-marked cable

the Ra pulldown is on the vbus pin
while Rd/Rp is on the CC pin
that allows detecting if its an e-marked cable, seperately from what is on the remote end of the cable

the CC wire in the usb-cable will link CC1<->CC1 on either end of the cable
the VCONN on CC2 will either be open or have diodes to block the flow

the pullup and pulldown then form a voltage divider, and the voltage on the CC pin defines what both parties are
if the cable is flipped, that voltage will be present on CC2 instead of CC1

after detecting which way its flipped, the downstream (power source) device can put +5v onto VBUS line (whichever is not CC)


Rp should be:
+-------------------+----------+-----------+----------------+
| current available | ~5v rail | 3.3v rail | current source |
+-------------------+----------+-----------+----------------+
| 500mA/900mA       |  56k     |    36k    |    80 uA       |
|    1.5A @ 5V      |   22k    |    12k    |    180 uA      |
|    3.0A @ 5V      |   10k    |    4.7k   |    330 uA      |
+-------------------+----------+-----------+----------------+

Ra should be between 800ohm and 1.2kohm


USB-PD master is the thing supplying power (downstream port)
all comms happen on the CC line
32bit message, with 4b/5b encoded bi-phase mark coded
300k Baud rate
crc32 error detection + message retries

USB-PD also deals with alternate mode negotiation
and deciding which party is usb-host and which is usb-device

rev 1.1 pi4b has 5.1k pulldowns

root@raspberrypi:~# vcgencmd measure_volts usb_pd
volt=1.7600V

one ADC channel on the PMIC is routed to one CC line, and can read the center of the voltage-divider, if the cable is "not flipped"

> 5 * (5.1 / (9.35+5.1))
1.7647058823529411
assuming 5v on the source (official rpi psu), and 5.1k on the pi4, the psu has a 9.35k pullup

vcgencmd measure_volts ain1
the 2nd ADC on the PMIC, usually tied to gnd
