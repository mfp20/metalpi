To contribute to `metal-pi` please hop on [Discord dedicated server](https://discord.gg/KhsCRdtj) or [Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#raspberrypi-internals) before starting anything. While not strictly a rule, this prevents duplicate work and we hope to be able to put to good use the huge amount of experiments and documents produced in the past 10 years.

We accept pull requests over Github or handling patches on IRC/Discord for review and merge.

A few notes on style:

* Contributors should use hard tabs.
* C is the preferred language for low-level code.
* C++ is the preferred language for high-level code.
* Generally follow conventions of similar code in the project.
