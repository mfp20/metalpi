SD_IDL total clocks the sdram has been idle?
SD_CYC total clocks since last reset

writing 0 to SD_IDL will zero both counts?

both are 28bit ints, that dont overflow
at 400mhz, it will overflow between 0.5 and 1 seconds, so you must poll every 0.5 seconds at least

2020-06-12 05:00:41 < geist> yah that makes sense, given it says it's LPDDR4-3200
2020-06-12 05:00:53 < geist> so yeah that's 400 * 2 (DDR) * 4 (32bit wide)
2020-06-12 05:00:56 < clever> timestamp since boot, clocks idle, total clocks, percent, counters reset every half second
2020-06-12 05:00:57 < doug16k> ya but ddr though. 800mhz ram is 400mhz clocked
2020-06-12 05:00:59 < geist> hence 3200MB/sec

2020-06-12 05:18:55 < doug16k> clever, that ram appears to have 8192 rows
2020-06-12 05:18:58 < clever> but i cant see any obvious ratio between 19.2 and 400, that involves 0x53 with any shift
2020-06-12 05:19:07 < doug16k> 0.064/0.00000778
2020-06-12 05:19:13 < geist> 19.2 * 0x53 (83) == 1593.6
2020-06-12 05:19:22 < geist> 1593.6 / 4 = 398.4
2020-06-12 05:19:27 < clever> oh


2020-06-12 05:29:16 < clever> there is also a function in the firmware, that maps an enum to one of the following ints: 1350, 2160, 2400, 2667, 3200, 3733
2020-06-12 05:29:27 < clever> would 3733 fit your benchmarks?
2020-06-12 05:29:35 < geist> 3733 would fit yeah
2020-06-12 05:29:47 < geist> it's a brand new 8GB model, maybe they bumped the frequency for it
2020-06-12 05:30:05 < clever> i'm looking at the firmware from 2020-05-15, which predates the release i believe
2020-06-12 05:31:30 < clever> ive also found new info on the vl805, where it doesnt have enough ram to hold its own firmware
2020-06-12 05:31:31 < geist> oh hmm, i think my calculations are all off anyway. looks like DDR3 and DDR4 run at quad data rate
2020-06-12 05:31:40 < geist> ie, a 400mhz DDR4 is actually clocking data at 1600mhz
2020-06-12 05:31:40 < clever> so its basically reading its own firmware/state out of system dram
2020-06-12 05:31:48 < clever> and probably has its own L1/L2 cache internally
2020-06-12 05:31:52 < geist> + *2 for DDR
2020-06-12 05:32:04 < geist> so *thats* where the 3200 comes from. it's the transfer rate per pin
2020-06-12 05:32:08 < clever> ahh

2020-10-12 04:16:28 < clever> https://www.jedec.org/sites/default/files/docs/JESD209-2B.pdf appears to be a jedec datasheet, but they have some fingerprinting of their own going on
2020-10-12 04:16:39 < clever> you must register an acct with a name/company/email first to view it
2020-10-12 04:16:52 < clever> and the company name you give, is embeded in the background of every page of the datasheet
2020-10-12 04:17:18 < clever> your name/email and timestamp is even in the footer of every page

exactly 1gig worth of dram


2020-10-12 06:16:07 < doug16k> 512M = 2^29. half that is 15 so probably 2^14 or 2^15 byte row
2020-10-12 06:17:26 < clever> if it was 262144 bits per row, then both the row# and col# would span 0-127, 7 bits
2020-10-12 06:17:29 < doug16k> that tells you explicitly
2020-10-12 06:17:52 < clever> assuming perfectly square matrix of rows
2020-10-12 06:18:09 < doug16k> ya row is a huge L1 cache in a sense
2020-10-12 06:18:29 < doug16k> well
2020-10-12 06:18:30 < doug16k> L2
