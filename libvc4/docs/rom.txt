there are only 2 differences between the rpi1 and rpi2 rom's i have dumped

1: a 100 got changed to a 228 in an unknown function
2: an unsafe memcmp for the signature, got replaced with a constant-time memcmp
    by pi3-era, that memcmp got inlined into the relevant function, and pi4 is still the same

pi1/pi2 rom boot sequence

the top 0x10c0 of the L2 cache is used as a scratch space by some loaders

1: sdhost, enabled by bit 21
    bit 22, 1==GPIO22-27, 0==GPIO48-53
2: sdhci 4bit mode, enabled by bit 23
    bit 23-24, 1==GPIO22-27, 2==GPIO34-39, 3==GPIO48-53
3: nand flash, enabled by bit 5
    bit 13 0, GPIO 0 to width+7 ALT1
      bit 8 width, 0==8bit, 1==16bit
    bit 13 1, GPIO 28-43 ALT1
4: sdhci 8bit capable, enabled by bits 25-26 being non-zero
    bits 25-26, 1=GPIO22-27, 2==34-43, 3==48-53
5: spi0 boot, enabled by bits 30-31 being non-zero
    bit 30-31, 1==GPIO7-11=ALT0, 2==GPIO35-39=ALT0, 3==GPIO46-49=ALT2(undocumented altmode)
    not confirmed 100%, but it looks very similar to rpi4, a 0x55aaf00f magic, length prefix, then raw bootcode.bin
6: usb-device boot, as documented in usbboot, enabled with bit28==1 and bit29==0
7: i2c slave, enabled by bit 27
  GPIO18-19 = ALT3
  send the same 24 byte boot_message_t as usbboot
  send the entire bootcode.bin
  it is not smbus based, so no register, just raw i2c writes
  i2c address 0x66
  never responds to i2c reads
8: MPHI boot, enabled by bit19==0
  ?????

pi3 rom boot sequence
1: sdhost
2: sdhci 4bit
3: nand
4: sdhci 8bit
5: spi0 boot
6: usb-device, enabled by only bit28 now
7: i2c-slave

B0 first 2711 revision
B1 silicon adds RSA signatures to rom, fixes DMA
C0 revision adds more clock gating for pi400


the C0 gating, involves turning the clock to a component off, any time it doesnt need a clock

> The ROM issue with exFAT is a known issue in B0 - don't make the first partition exFAT.
