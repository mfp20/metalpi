low voltage detection:

> 3B+ and 4B poll the PMIC, other devices with under-voltage detection have a simple circuit made of discrete components that drives a GPIO.

> A little bit more information on the low power detection circuit on the Pi4/400 that I didn't know!
> There is a range where the detection is guaranteed to fire, might fire, and wont fire. This is down to the PMIC, nothing to do with us.
> 0-4.52 Will fire
> 4.52-4.65 Might fire
> 4.65-5.1+ Won't fire
> Since 4.52, the guaranteed detection point, is below our PS specification range, we are in the clear here, as before, there is nothing to worry about.


CM4 uses MxL7704
