reading over it, it will detect the following MBR type codes
0x83 (linux stuff, completely ignored)
0xee (gpt protective mbr)
0x01, 0x04, 0x06, 0x0b, 0x0c, 0x0e (all the fats)
0x07 (ntfs or exfat) has a special branch in the code
if it encounters any other type, i think it stops iterating over partitions
