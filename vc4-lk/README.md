# vc4-lk

The [LittleKernel](https://github.com/littlekernel/lk) embedded kernel: an SMP-aware kernel designed for small systems. This is a modified version to support Broadcom's VideoCore IV and it is part of the [Metal-Pi platform](https://github.com/mfp20/metalpi); but it can be used standalone for your own delight.
