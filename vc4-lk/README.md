# Available projects:
## rpi1-test
builds LK for the armv6 found on the pi0 and pi1

currently not working on this overlay

## rpi2-test
builds LK for the cortex-A7 found in a pi2

use lk.bin as your kernel.img file, with the official firmware

## rpi3-test
builds LK in aarch64 mode for the cortex-A53 found in a pi3

use lk.bin as your kernel.img file, with the official firmware

## rpi3-bootcode
builds LK for the VPU on any VC4 pi (pi0 to pi3), use lk.bin as bootcode.bin

## rpi3-start
buids LK for the VPU on any VC4 pi (pi0 to pi3), use lk.elf as start.elf, with either the official bootcode.bin or vc4-stage1

## rpi4-recovery
builds LK for the VPU on a VC6 pi (pi4, pi400, CM4), use lk.bin as recovery.bin or bootcode.bin in spi flash, must be signed with https://github.com/librerpi/rpi-tools/tree/master/signing-tool

## rpi4-start4
builds LK for the VPU on a VC6 pi (pi4, pi400, CM4), use lk.elf as start4.elf, with the official SPI firmware

## vc4-stage1
builds LK as a bootcode.bin replacement, loads lk.elf from either an ext2 partition or xmodem over the uart

## vc4-stage2
a test stage2 for use with vc4-stage1, currently it just brings the DPI online

## vc4-start
a test stage2, that will embed rpi1-test into itself, and run LK on both the VPU and ARM
