In order to build the default distribution the quickstart in the README is enough. In the case you are willing to customize the code you'll need to build the [vc4-toolchain](https://github.com/mfp20/vc4-toolchain) as well as an arm-none-eabi toolchain ([example](http://newos.org/toolchains/arm-eabi-5.3.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.xz)). Then `make` is used to build the components.
